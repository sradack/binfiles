- Summarizes what changed and why
- Uses imperative mood (e.g., 'Add feature' not 'Added feature')
- Is concise (1-2 sentences for simple changes)
- Follows conventional commit style if appropriate (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
- Does NOT include any attribution, signature, or mention of AI/Claude/Anthropic
